# Difference Between Software Verification and Validation

**Verification** and **Validation** are two critical aspects of software quality assurance, each with distinct objectives in ensuring the reliability of software products. Both processes play complementary roles in evaluating software, but they focus on different aspects of the development lifecycle.

---

## 1. Verification

- **Definition**: Verification is the process of evaluating work products (such as design documents, code, requirements) during development to ensure that they meet the specified requirements. It answers the question, *"Are we building the product right?"*
  
- **Focus**: Ensures that the software conforms to its design and adheres to the requirements/specifications.
  
- **Objective**: To ensure that the software development process follows the correct steps and meets the intended design specifications.
  
- **When**: Performed throughout the **development phase** of the SDLC, during design, coding, and before final testing.

- **Activities**:
  - Reviews (code, design, requirements)
  - Inspections
  - Walkthroughs
  - Static testing (analyzing code without execution)

- **Examples**:
  - Code reviews to check for adherence to coding standards.
  - Design reviews to ensure the design matches architectural plans.
  - Requirement reviews to verify completeness and correctness.

- **Type of Testing**: Primarily **static** testing techniques (reviewing without running the code).

## 2. Validation

- **Definition**: Validation is the process of evaluating the final product to ensure it meets the user needs and requirements. It answers the question, *"Are we building the right product?"*

- **Focus**: Ensures that the product works as expected in real-world scenarios and meets the user's needs.
  
- **Objective**: To ensure that the software product fulfills its intended use when deployed in the actual operating environment.
  
- **When**: Performed **after the development phase** and during testing (especially in later stages like system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and deployment).
  
- **Activities**:
  - Functional testing
  - System testing
  - User acceptance testing (UAT)
  - Performance testing
  - Beta testing with real users
  
- **Examples**:
  - Running system tests to validate that all features function as required.
  - User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to validate that the product meets end-user requirements.
  - Beta testing to gather feedback from real users in a production-like environment.

- **Type of Testing**: Primarily **dynamic** testing techniques (executing the software).

## Key Differences

| **Aspect**             | **Verification**                             | **Validation**                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Objective**           | Ensures the product is being built correctly (according to specifications). | Ensures the right product is being built (according to user needs). |
| **Focus**               | Process-oriented (ensures proper steps are followed). | Product-oriented (ensures final product meets expectations). |
| **Question**            | "Are we building the product right?"         | "Are we building the right product?"       |
| **When**                | Performed during development (early stages). | Performed after development (testing stage). |
| **Testing Type**        | Static testing (reviews, walkthroughs, inspections). | Dynamic testing (running and testing the software). |
| **Examples**            | Requirement reviews, design reviews, code reviews. | System testing, UAT, beta testing, performance testing. |

## Conclusion

- **Verification** ensures that the product conforms to specifications and is built correctly by focusing on design, code, and process evaluations.
- **Validation** ensures that the end product satisfies user needs and functions as intended in real-world scenarios.

Both verification and validation are essential for delivering a high-quality software product that is both correctly built and functional for end users.
