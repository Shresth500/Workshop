# Software Testing Lifecycle (STLC)

### Overview

The **Software Testing Lifecycle (STLC)** is a systematic process used to test software for quality, performance, and functionality before it is released. STLC involves multiple phases, from the identification of requirements to the final testing and closure of the testing process. Each phase of STLC is designed to ensure that defects are detected early, and the software meets its intended requirements.

Unlike the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**, which focuses on the development phases, STLC is specifically concerned with the **testing process** within the overall development lifecycle.

## Phases of the Software Testing Lifecycle (STLC)

### 1. **Requirement Analysis**

**Purpose**: To understand and analyze the testing requirements based on the functional and non-functional aspects of the software to be tested.

**Activities**:
- Identify **testable requirements**.
- Engage with stakeholders (business analysts, developers) to clarify any requirements.
- Identify the types of tests to be performed (e.g., functional, performance, security).
- Define **testing priorities** and risk areas.

**Deliverables**:
- [Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)](./artifacts/06-requirement-traceability-matrix-rtm.md).
- Identified test requirements (both functional and non-functional).

---

### 2. **Test Planning**

**Purpose**: To create a detailed **test plan** that defines the testing strategy, objectives, scope, timeline, and resources needed.

**Activities**:
- Define the **scope of testing**.
- Determine the **test environment** and testing tools.
- Estimate the **time**, **cost**, and **resources** required for testing.
- Identify **roles and responsibilities** for the testing team.
- Define the **exit criteria** (conditions to conclude testing).
- Prepare a **test risk management** plan.

**Deliverables**:
- [**Test Plan** document](./artifacts/07-test-plan.md).
- **Test Effort Estimation**.
- **Test Schedule**.

### 3. **Test Case Design and Development**

**Purpose**: To design detailed test cases that cover all the test scenarios for the software based on the requirements.

**Activities**:
- Design **test cases** for different test scenarios.
- Prioritize and organize test cases.
- Identify and prepare **test data** for executing the test cases.
- Map test cases to requirements (using a Requirement Traceability Matrix - RTM) to ensure coverage.

**Deliverables**:
- [Detailed **test cases**](./artifacts/08-test-cases.md).
- **Test data** required for executing the tests.
- **Test scripts** if automation is involved.

---

### 4. **Test Environment Setup**

**Purpose**: To prepare the necessary environment, including hardware, software, network configuration, and testing tools, where testing will take place.

**Activities**:
- Set up the **test environment** based on the system requirements.
- Ensure all necessary **testing tools** are installed and configured.
- Verify that the **test environment** is ready for execution.
- Prepare [**test beds**](./artifacts/09-test-bed.md) for specific test configurations.
- Conduct a **smoke test** (basic test) to validate the test environment’s stability.

**Deliverables**:
- **Test environment setup**.
- Confirmation of environment readiness (from smoke tests).

---

### 5. **Test Execution**

**Purpose**: To execute the designed test cases and compare the actual results against the expected results.

**Activities**:
- Execute test cases **manually** or through **automation tools**.
- Record the **test results** (pass/fail).
- Log **defects** in case of test failures.
- Re-execute tests after fixing defects (retesting).
- Perform **regression testing** to ensure new code changes don’t break existing functionality.

**Deliverables**:
- **Test execution results**.
- **Defect reports** with details of issues found.
- Updated **Requirement Traceability Matrix** (RTM) with execution status.

---

### 6. **Test Closure**

**Purpose**: To formally close the testing phase and evaluate the testing efforts, outcomes, and overall software quality.

**Activities**:
- **Analyze test results** and determine whether all requirements were met.
- Check if the **exit criteria** defined in the test plan are satisfied.
- Prepare a **Test Closure Report** summarizing the testing activities, defects found, test coverage, and the overall quality of the software.
- Conduct a **test retrospective** meeting to discuss what went well and what could be improved in future testing efforts.
- Archive test cases, results, and defect reports for future reference.

**Deliverables**:
- **Test Summary Report**.
- [**Test Closure Report**](./artifacts/10-test-closure-report.md).
- Testing metrics and lessons learned.

### Key Features of STLC

1. **Well-Defined Phases**: Each phase of the STLC has clearly defined objectives and deliverables to ensure thorough and effective testing.
   
2. **Test-Driven Approach**: The STLC ensures that testing is integrated into the software development process, helping detect defects early and improve the overall quality of the product.

3. **Iterative Process**: While the phases are sequential, STLC is iterative in nature, allowing for re-execution and continuous improvement throughout the testing cycle.

4. **Focus on Risk Management**: Test planning and execution focus on identifying and mitigating risks early in the lifecycle to prevent high-cost fixes in later stages.

### Conclusion

The **Software Testing Lifecycle (STLC)** is a structured process that ensures testing is systematic, efficient, and aligned with the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It helps detect defects early, validate requirements, and ensure that the software meets both functional and non-functional requirements. Each phase of STLC plays a crucial role in ensuring that the product is of high quality and is ready for release.
