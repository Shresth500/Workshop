# High-Level Design (HLD) for Online Store Web Application

## 1. Architecture Overview

The online store application will follow a **three-tier architecture**:

- **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**: React (Create React App)
- **Application Layer (Backend)**: Node.js with Express (REST API or GraphQL)
- **Database Layer**: 
  - **MongoDB**: Product catalog
  - **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Order processing and user data

## 2. Main Components

### User Interface (UI)
- **Product Listings**: Browse/search/filter products.
- **Product Detail Pages**: Detailed view of each product.
- **Shopping Cart**: Manage items in the cart.
- **Checkout Process**: Handle user input for orders and payments.
- **User Account**: Manage profile, order history, and preferences.

### Backend Services
- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user login (OAuth or JWT).
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for product catalog.
- **Shopping Cart Management**: Save and update userâ€™s cart.
- **Order Management**: Manage order placement and tracking.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Support payments via Stripe, PayPal, etc.
- **Email Notifications**: Send order confirmations and shipping details.

### Databases
- **MongoDB**: For product catalog (schema-less, fast search).
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: For storing orders, users, and payments.

### External Integrations
- **Payment Gateways**: Stripe, PayPal integration.
- **Shipping APIs**: Integrate with shipping services (e.g., FedEx, UPS).

## 3. Security Considerations
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for user/admin roles.
- **Data Encryption**: SSL for communication, bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Credit card details handled by the payment gateway.

## 4. System Interfaces

### API Endpoints
- **User Authentication**: Registration, login, and logout endpoints.
- **Product APIs**: For listing, filtering, adding, and managing products.
- **Cart APIs**: Add, update, and remove items in the shopping cart.
- **Order APIs**: Place and retrieve user orders.
- **Payment APIs**: Process payments via external gateways (Stripe, PayPal).

### External APIs
- **Payment**: Stripe/PayPal APIs for processing payments.
- **Shipping**: FedEx, UPS for handling and tracking shipments.

## 5. High-Level Data Flow

1. **Browse Products**: User interacts with the frontend to browse/search products.
2. **Add to Cart**: User adds products to the cart, which is saved in the backend.
3. **Checkout Process**: User checks out, enters payment details, and submits an order.
4. **Payment Processing**: The payment is processed using an external gateway.
5. **Order Confirmation**: The order is stored in the database, and a confirmation email is sent.
6. **Shipping**: Order is prepared for shipment and can be tracked using an API.

## 6. Key Components Breakdown

### Frontend (React)
- **Product Display**: Dynamically shows available products.
- **User Account Management**: Allows users to view order history, update account information.
- **Cart & Checkout**: Handles the cart operations and the checkout process.

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Business Logic**: Handles all backend services such as product management, user management, order processing, and payment handling.
- **APIs**: Expose RESTful endpoints to be consumed by the frontend for seamless data flow.

### Databases
- **MongoDB**: 
  - Stores product data for quick access and flexible schema changes.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**:
  - Stores structured data such as user details, orders, and transactions.

## 7. Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js (Create React App)
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **Routing**: React Router

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **API**: REST or GraphQL
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0, JWT for authentication

### Database
- **Product Catalog**: MongoDB
- **Orders & Users**: MySQL or PostgreSQL

### External Integrations
- **Payments**: Stripe or PayPal
- **Shipping**: FedEx or UPS APIs
- **Email**: Nodemailer for sending email notifications

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Able to handle increased traffic as the user base grows.
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast product searches and minimal checkout latency.
- **Security**: Protect user data, payments, and sensitive information.
- **Availability**: Ensure high uptime with load balancing and auto-scaling.

## 9. Deployment and Hosting

- **Hosting**: Cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or similar.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple servers to handle traffic.
- **Database Scaling**: Use database replication and sharding for high availability.

## 10. Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Prometheus for performance monitoring.
- **Logging**: Store logs using ELK stack or a cloud logging service.
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts for downtime, performance degradation, and security threats.
