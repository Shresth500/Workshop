## 3. Feasibility Study Components

### 3.1 Technical Feasibility
This section examines whether the technology needed to implement the system is available and whether the team has the technical capabilities to develop the application.

- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Frontend**: React.js (for a dynamic and responsive UI)
  - **Backend**: Node.js with Express (for handling server-side operations)
  - **Database**: MongoDB (to store user data, event details, RSVP statuses, etc.)
  - **Hosting**: AWS (for cloud infrastructure and scalability)
  - **Payment Gateway**: Stripe or PayPal integration for handling vendor payments.

- **Tools**:
  - **Version Control**: Git/GitHub for source code management.
  - **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Postman for API testing, JIRA for project management.

- **Challenges**:
  - The integration of various APIs for email invitations, payment gateways, and venue booking might present some complexity.
  - Ensuring the security of user data (such as payment and personal details) will require robust encryption and authentication protocols (e.g., JWT, OAuth).

- **Conclusion**: 
  The technical requirements are feasible given the current technological landscape and the skill set of the development team. Suitable tools and platforms are available for the successful development of the system.

### 3.2 Economic Feasibility
This section focuses on the financial implications of the project, including the estimated cost and the return on investment (ROI).

- **Estimated Development Costs**:
  - Development team: $80,000
  - Design and UX: $10,000
  - Hosting & Infrastructure: $5,000 per year
  - Marketing and promotions: $15,000
  - Total: $110,000

- **Revenue Model**:
  - Subscription plans for event organizers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise).
  - Commission on venue and vendor bookings.
  - Advertisements for event-related products and services.

- **Break-even Analysis**:
  With an average monthly subscription fee of $25 per user and an estimated 1,000 subscribers in the first year, the system is expected to break even within 18 months.

- **Conclusion**: 
  The project is economically feasible, with moderate development costs and potential for long-term profitability through subscription-based revenue and commission on bookings.

### 3.3 Operational Feasibility
Operational feasibility assesses whether the organization can implement the system successfully with the available human, technical, and financial resources.

- **Current Resources**:
  - **Development Team**: The in-house team includes skilled developers, UI/UX designers, and project managers.
  - **Management**: The project will be managed by experienced project managers with a focus on Agile methodologies.
  - **End Users**: The target audience includes corporate event managers, wedding planners, and individuals organizing personal events.

- **Support and Maintenance**:
  - Regular updates and patches will be required to improve system functionality.
  - A dedicated support team will handle user queries and issues post-launch.

- **Conclusion**: 
  The organization has the necessary resources and expertise to develop and maintain the system. The project is operationally feasible.

### 3.4 Schedule Feasibility
This section outlines the estimated project timeline and whether it is feasible to complete the project within the desired timeframe.

- **Estimated Timeline**:
  - Requirements Gathering & Analysis: 2 weeks
  - UI/UX Design: 4 weeks
  - Frontend and Backend Development: 10 weeks
  - Testing (Unit, Integration, and User Acceptance Testing): 3 weeks
  - Deployment and Launch: 2 weeks
  - Total Duration: 21 weeks (approx. 5 months)

- **Conclusion**: 
  Given the complexity of the project and the availability of resources, the proposed timeline of 5 months is feasible for the successful completion of the project.

## 4. Risk Analysis

- **Technical Risks**: 
  - Integration of external APIs for venue bookings may cause delays if third-party services are unreliable.
  - Security risks associated with storing sensitive user data, including personal and payment details.

- **Economic Risks**:
  - Failure to reach the target user base could result in lower subscription revenue.
  - Increased competition from similar event management platforms may reduce profitability.

- **Operational Risks**:
  - Inadequate training of support staff could lead to poor user experience.
  - Scaling issues during peak event seasons (e.g., wedding season) might affect system performance.

## 5. Recommendations

- **Proceed with Development**: Based on the feasibility analysis, the project is viable from technical, economic, operational, and schedule perspectives. It is recommended to proceed with development.
- **Risk Mitigation**:
  - Implement rigorous security protocols such as SSL encryption and secure authentication.
  - Develop contingency plans for handling third-party API downtime.
  - Monitor market trends and adjust the revenue model accordingly.
