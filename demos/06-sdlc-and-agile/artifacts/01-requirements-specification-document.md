## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to specify the functional and non-functional requirements for developing an **Online Store Web Application**. This web-based system will enable users to browse products, make purchases, manage orders, and track deliveries. The document will serve as a reference for developers, testers, and stakeholders throughout the software development lifecycle.

### 1.2 Scope
The **Online Store Web Application** will provide a platform for customers to:
- Browse a catalog of products.
- View detailed information on individual products.
- Add products to a shopping cart.
- Make online payments.
- Track orders and delivery status.
- Manage their personal profiles, shipping addresses, and order history.

The admin users will be able to manage products, process orders, and view sales reports.

## 2. System Overview

The system will be divided into two primary interfaces:
- **Customer Interface**: Allows users to browse products, make purchases, and track their orders.
- **Admin Interface**: Enables administrators to manage inventory, process orders, and view reports.

The system will integrate with payment gateways and support notifications via email or SMS for order confirmations and updates.
