# Overview of Use Cases and Use Case Level Test Cases

---

## 1. What is a Use Case?

A **Use Case** is a **formal description of how a user interacts** with a system to achieve a specific goal. It focuses on **user actions and system responses**, outlining the sequence of events that take place between the user (actor) and the system. Use cases help in understanding the **requirements** from a user's perspective and serve as the foundation for test case creation. 

### Key Components of a Use Case

1. **Actor**:
   - The user or external system interacting with the software (e.g., a customer or admin).

2. **Preconditions**:
   - Conditions that must be true before the use case can start (e.g., the user must be logged in).

3. **Main Flow / Primary Scenario**:
   - The main path that the interaction follows to achieve the goal.

4. **Alternative Flows**:
   - Variations or alternative ways in which the interaction could proceed.

5. **Exception Flows**:
   - Error or failure scenarios where the interaction deviates from the main flow.

6. **Postconditions**:
   - The state of the system after the use case has been executed (e.g., an order is confirmed).

## 2. What are Use Case Level Test Cases?

**Use Case Level Test Cases** are derived from **use cases** and describe the **specific actions and system behaviors** that need to be validated during testing. Each test case maps to a **scenario** within the use case (main flow, alternative flow, or exception flow) to ensure that the system behaves correctly for all possible interactions.

## 3. Structure of Use Case Level Test Cases

Each **test case** associated with a use case should cover one or more specific scenarios. A well-written test case includes:

1. **Test Case ID**:
   - A unique identifier for the test case (e.g., `UC-TC-01`).

2. **Use Case Reference**:
   - The ID or name of the use case the test case belongs to (e.g., `UC-Login`).

3. **Test Scenario / Description**:
   - Describes what is being tested (e.g., "Verify user login with valid credentials").

4. **Preconditions**:
   - Conditions that must be satisfied before the test can be executed.

5. **Test Steps**:
   - Detailed steps the tester must follow to execute the test.

6. **Expected Results**:
   - The expected outcome of the test (e.g., "User is logged in and redirected to the dashboard").

7. **Actual Results** (during execution):
   - The observed outcome during the test run.

8. **Status**:
   - Whether the test passed or failed (e.g., Pass/Fail).

## 4. Example of a Use Case and Use Case Level Test Cases

### Example Use Case: **User Login**

#### Actor:
- User

#### Preconditions:
- The user has registered on the platform.

#### Main Flow:
1. The user navigates to the login page.
2. The user enters valid credentials (username and password).
3. The system verifies the credentials and redirects the user to the dashboard.

#### Alternative Flow:
1. The user enters **invalid credentials**.
2. The system displays an error message: "Invalid username or password."

#### Exception Flow:
1. The **system is down**, and the user cannot log in.
2. The system displays an error: "Service unavailable. Please try again later."

## 5. Benefits of Use Case Level Test Cases

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - Ensures all possible flows (main, alternative, and exception) are tested.

2. **Alignment with Business Requirements**:
   - Test cases align with the **userâ€™s interactions** with the system, ensuring the application meets business needs.

3. **Better Communication**:
   - Helps bridge the gap between **business stakeholders and testers**, as both parties can understand use cases easily.

4. **Early Defect Detection**:
   - Use cases are often created during the **requirement analysis phase**, allowing testers to identify **gaps or inconsistencies** early on.

## 6. Conclusion

Use cases provide a **clear and structured way to describe user interactions** with a system, and **use case level test cases** ensure that all possible scenarios are validated during testing. By mapping test cases directly to use cases, organizations can achieve **comprehensive coverage**, **align testing efforts with business goals**, and improve the **quality and usability** of the final product. This approach ensures that both **functional and edge-case behaviors** are validated thoroughly.
