# Test Control

### Definition
**Test Control** is the process of **monitoring** and **adjusting** the testing activities and resources in response to changes or deviations from the original test plan. It involves taking **corrective actions** to align the testing process with project goals, schedules, or quality objectives. The objective of test control is to ensure that the testing activities stay on track and that any issues or risks are managed effectively.

Test control is part of the **test management** process and works in conjunction with **test monitoring**. While monitoring involves observing the progress of testing, **test control** takes action based on the insights gathered during monitoring.

## Purpose of Test Control

- **Manage Deviations**: To handle deviations from the test plan, such as delays in test execution, higher-than-expected defect rates, or changes in requirements.
- **Mitigate Risks**: To manage risks that arise during testing, such as resource shortages, test environment instability, or scope changes.
- **Ensure Quality**: To ensure that the testing process consistently meets defined quality criteria and objectives.
- **Adapt to Change**: To adjust to changes in scope, deadlines, or available resources without compromising testing goals.

## Key Activities in Test Control

### 1. **Tracking Progress**
Test control involves continuously tracking and measuring progress against the **test plan**. This includes monitoring:
- **Test case execution rates** (how many test cases are executed vs. planned).
- **Defect discovery rates** and trends.
- **Resource allocation** (e.g., whether testing teams are under-resourced or overburdened).
- **Test environment readiness** and stability.

### 2. **Managing Changes**
When deviations from the test plan occur, test control steps in to manage these changes. For example:
- Adjusting the **test schedule** if the development is delayed or if new features are added.
- Reallocating **resources** to critical areas of testing.
- Modifying **test priorities** to focus on high-risk areas.

### 3. **Risk Management**
Test control actively manages risks during the testing process, which includes:
- **Identifying new risks** that emerge during testing, such as integration issues or performance bottlenecks.
- **Mitigating risks** by implementing contingency plans or reallocating resources to address high-risk areas.

### 4. **Corrective Actions**
Based on monitoring data, **corrective actions** are taken to bring the testing process back on track. Examples include:
- Increasing the number of testers or shifting resources to meet critical deadlines.
- Reducing the test scope by deferring low-priority tests to meet release dates.
- Replanning test execution when critical defects are found.

### 5. **Adjusting Test Plans**
As new information becomes available during testing, test plans may need to be updated. This includes:
- Revising the **test strategy** or approach based on the current state of the system.
- Updating **test case priorities** to align with the evolving needs of the project.

## Examples of Test Control in Action

1. **Scenario: Delays in Test Execution**
   - If test execution falls behind schedule due to resource constraints, test control involves reallocating resources or extending testing timelines. For example, if there are delays in automating test cases, manual testers may be assigned to help with execution temporarily.

2. **Scenario: High Defect Rate in Critical Module**
   - If a critical module shows a higher-than-expected defect rate, test control involves shifting focus to test that module more thoroughly. This could involve delaying less critical tests or assigning additional testers to focus on fixing and retesting the critical module.

3. **Scenario: Change in Business Requirements**
   - If thereâ€™s a last-minute change in business requirements, test control will adjust the test plan to accommodate the new requirements. This could mean reprioritizing test cases or delaying non-essential tests.

## Importance of Test Control

- **Ensures Flexibility**: Test control allows the testing process to remain flexible and adaptable to unforeseen changes, which is crucial in **Agile** and **iterative development environments**.
- **Improves Quality**: By continuously monitoring and making necessary adjustments, test control helps ensure the quality of the software and the effectiveness of the testing process.
- **Aligns with Project Goals**: It ensures that testing activities are aligned with the **overall project objectives** and timelines, reducing the risk of major delays or missed deadlines.
- **Enhances Risk Management**: Test control enables better **risk management** by providing a structured approach to addressing risks and issues during testing.

## Conclusion

**Test Control** is a critical aspect of the software testing process, ensuring that testing stays on course despite potential obstacles or changes in the project. It involves taking **corrective actions** to manage deviations, risks, and changes in the testing process, helping teams meet testing objectives efficiently while maintaining software quality.
