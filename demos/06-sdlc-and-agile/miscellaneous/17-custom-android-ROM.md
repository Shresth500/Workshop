## What is a Custom ROM?

A **Custom ROM** is a modified version of the original firmware (operating system) that comes pre-installed on an Android device. It is developed by independent developers or communities and replaces the stock ROM (original firmware) provided by the device manufacturer. 

Custom ROMs are built from the **Android Open Source Project (AOSP)** code, and they often offer **features, performance improvements, and updates** not available in the stock firmware.

## How Custom ROMs Work

- **ROM** stands for **Read-Only Memory**, referring to the part of a device’s storage that contains the operating system.
- **Custom ROMs** replace the stock ROM with a new version of the operating system, often introducing new features and removing manufacturer or carrier bloatware.
- Installing a custom ROM requires **unlocking the device’s bootloader** and **flashing the new ROM** through a custom recovery tool like **TWRP** (Team Win Recovery Project).

## Why Use a Custom ROM?

1. **Remove Bloatware**:
   - Stock ROMs often come with pre-installed apps and services (bloatware) that can’t be removed. Custom ROMs remove these unwanted apps.

2. **Faster Updates**:
   - Manufacturers may stop providing updates for older devices. Custom ROMs allow users to install the latest **Android versions** and security patches.

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Custom ROMs can enhance performance by optimizing system processes and removing unnecessary features.

4. **Customization Options**:
   - Custom ROMs offer advanced customization of the **UI, themes, settings, and system features**.

5. **Root Access and Control**:
   - Some custom ROMs provide **root access**, giving users deeper control over their device, such as tweaking system-level settings.

6. **Enhanced Privacy and Security**:
   - Some ROMs focus on **privacy** by removing proprietary tracking features found in stock ROMs.
