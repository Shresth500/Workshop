# Function Point (FP)

### Overview

A **Function Point (FP)** is a **unit of measurement** used to express the amount of business functionality provided by a software system. Function Points measure software size in terms of the **functionality delivered** to the user, rather than focusing on the lines of code or technical aspects of the system. Function Point Analysis (FPA) is a method used to estimate the size and complexity of a software system and is often used in **project management**, **cost estimation**, and **resource planning**.

### Purpose of Function Points
- **Measure software size**: Provides a standardized way to measure the functional size of a software project.
- **Estimate project effort**: Helps in estimating development effort, cost, and resources required for the project.
- **Benchmark productivity**: Allows teams to compare productivity across different projects based on the number of function points delivered.
- **Track progress**: Used to measure the progress of a project, especially in large-scale software development projects.

## Components of Function Points

Function Points are based on five major components that represent the types of functionalities delivered to the user. These components are classified as **External** and **Internal** functions.

### 1. **External Inputs (EI)**
- These are **user inputs** or data received by the system from an external source, such as user forms or input screens.
- Examples: User login form, product entry form in an e-commerce application.

### 2. **External Outputs (EO)**
- These are the **outputs** generated by the system in response to an external request, such as reports, messages, or status updates.
- Examples: Order confirmation email, sales reports generated for the admin.

### 3. **External Inquiries (EQ)**
- These are **inquiries** or requests from external users for data retrieval, where the input doesn’t require updating the internal data.
- Examples: Product search functionality, order status lookup.

### 4. **Internal Logical Files (ILF)**
- These are the **data files** maintained and managed internally by the system. They represent groups of logically related data.
- Examples: User account database, product catalog database.

### 5. **External Interface Files (EIF)**
- These are data files or data sources that are **maintained outside** the system but used by the system for reference purposes.
- Examples: Integration with a third-party payment gateway, external shipping data.

## How Function Points are Calculated

### Step 1: Identify and Categorize Functions
Each of the five components (EI, EO, EQ, ILF, EIF) is identified in the software system and categorized based on its complexity: **low**, **average**, or **high**. 

### Step 2: Assign Weights
Each function is assigned a specific **weight** based on its complexity. The weights are predefined in Function Point Analysis standards.

| **Function Type**           | **Low Complexity** | **Average Complexity** | **High Complexity** |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **External Inputs (EI)**     | 3 FP               | 4 FP                   | 6 FP                |
| **External Outputs (EO)**    | 4 FP               | 5 FP                   | 7 FP                |
| **External Inquiries (EQ)**  | 3 FP               | 4 FP                   | 6 FP                |
| **Internal Logical Files (ILF)** | 7 FP            | 10 FP                  | 15 FP               |
| **External Interface Files (EIF)** | 5 FP           | 7 FP                   | 10 FP               |

### Step 3: Calculate Unadjusted Function Points (UFP)
The **Unadjusted Function Points (UFP)** are calculated by summing the weighted values of all identified functions.

### Step 4: Apply Value Adjustment Factor (VAF)
The **Value Adjustment Factor (VAF)** accounts for factors such as system complexity, user interaction, and performance. The VAF is calculated based on 14 general system characteristics (GSCs) and ranges between 0.65 and 1.35.

### Step 5: Calculate Final Function Points
Finally, the **Adjusted Function Points** (FP) are calculated by multiplying the UFP by the VAF:

\[
\text{Adjusted Function Points (FP)} = \text{UFP} \times \text{VAF}
\]

## Example of Function Point Calculation

Imagine we are calculating function points for an **e-commerce system** with the following components:

- **External Inputs (EI)**: User registration, product addition, product review submission (3 average complexity functions).
- **External Outputs (EO)**: Order confirmation email, sales report (2 high complexity functions).
- **Internal Logical Files (ILF)**: Product catalog, user database, order database (3 average complexity logical files).
- **External Interface Files (EIF)**: Third-party payment gateway integration (1 average complexity function).

**Step 1**: Assign function points based on complexity:

| **Function Type**  | **Complexity** | **Count** | **Function Points** |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| External Inputs (EI) | Average        | 3         | 3 × 4 = 12          |
| External Outputs (EO)| High           | 2         | 2 × 7 = 14          |
| Internal Logical Files (ILF)| Average  | 3         | 3 × 10 = 30         |
| External Interface Files (EIF)| Average| 1         | 1 × 7 = 7           |

**Step 2**: Calculate **Unadjusted Function Points (UFP)**:
\[
\text{UFP} = 12 + 14 + 30 + 7 = 63
\]

**Step 3**: Apply a **Value Adjustment Factor (VAF)** (assuming 1.00 for simplicity):
\[
\text{Adjusted Function Points (FP)} = 63 \times 1.00 = 63
\]

## Benefits of Function Points

1. **Technology-Independent Measurement**: Function points focus on the **business functionality** of the system and are not tied to specific technologies or programming languages, making them applicable across different systems.
  
2. **Effort Estimation**: Function points help estimate the **effort, time, and resources** required to develop or maintain the software based on its functionality.
  
3. **Productivity Measurement**: Organizations can use function points to measure the **productivity** of development teams by tracking the function points delivered per unit of time.
  
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Function points allow for **comparisons** between different software systems, enabling better benchmarking and understanding of system complexity.

## Conclusion

**Function Points (FP)** provide a standardized way to measure the size and complexity of software systems based on the business functionality they deliver. They help project managers estimate effort, track productivity, and compare different projects or systems. By focusing on **what the software does** (rather than how it's built), function points offer a more user-centric way of measuring software size and complexity.
