# How Velocity is Calculated in Agile

---

## 1. What is Velocity?

**Velocity** in Agile is a key metric that measures the **amount of work completed** by a team during a sprint (or iteration). It helps teams predict how much work they can complete in future sprints, ensuring **better planning and delivery**. Velocity is typically measured in **story points**, but it can also be measured using hours, tasks, or other units.

---

## 2. Formula for Velocity Calculation

The formula to calculate velocity is:

**Velocity = Total Story Points Completed / Number of Sprints**

---

## 3. Steps to Calculate Velocity

1. **Select a Sprint Period**:  
   - Choose the sprints you want to measure (e.g., the past 3-5 sprints).  

2. **Sum the Completed Story Points**:  
   - Add the total **story points** of all user stories or tasks completed (fully completed, not partially) in each sprint.

3. **Divide by the Number of Sprints**:  
   - Divide the total completed story points by the number of sprints to get the **average velocity**.

## 4. Example of Velocity Calculation

### Scenario:
- **Sprint 1**: 30 story points completed  
- **Sprint 2**: 25 story points completed  
- **Sprint 3**: 35 story points completed  

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Total Story Points Completed** = 30 + 25 + 35 = **90 points**  
2. **Number of Sprints** = 3  
3. **Velocity** = 90 / 3 = **30 story points per sprint**

This means the team can likely complete **30 story points** in future sprints.

---

## 5. Key Considerations for Velocity Calculation

1. **Only Completed Stories Count**:
   - Partially completed stories do **not contribute** to the sprint’s velocity. Only fully completed tasks are included.

2. **Consistency Over Time**:
   - Velocity becomes more reliable after measuring it over **multiple sprints**.

3. **Use Historical Data**:
   - To improve accuracy, teams use an **average velocity** based on past sprints.

4. **Do Not Compare Across Teams**:
   - Velocity is a **team-specific metric** and should not be compared between different teams.

---

## 6. How Velocity Helps in Sprint Planning

1. **Capacity Planning**:
   - Knowing the team’s velocity allows them to **select a realistic amount of work** for the next sprint.

2. **Predicting Future Releases**:
   - Teams can predict **how many sprints** are needed to complete the product backlog.

3. **Managing Stakeholder Expectations**:
   - Velocity helps **set realistic deadlines** and deliverables for stakeholders.

---

## 7. Challenges of Using Velocity

1. **Fluctuations in Velocity**:
   - Velocity may vary due to unforeseen events like team absences or blockers.

2. **Over-Emphasis on Numbers**:
   - Teams might focus too much on increasing velocity rather than **delivering quality**.

3. **Misinterpreting Velocity**:
   - Higher velocity does not always mean higher productivity—it must be **interpreted in context**.

---

## 8. Example of Using Velocity for Forecasting

Assume the team’s average velocity is **30 story points per sprint**. If the product backlog contains **120 story points**, the team will need:

**120 / 30 = 4 sprints**

This means the team can plan to complete the entire backlog in **4 sprints**, assuming no major changes or delays.

---

## 9. Conclusion

**Velocity** is an essential metric in Agile that helps teams track their progress and plan for future sprints. It provides insight into the team’s capacity and helps predict **how long it will take** to complete the backlog. While velocity is a valuable tool, it should be used alongside other metrics and not as the sole indicator of success.
