# Calculation of Lead Time and Cycle Time in Agile

---

## 1. What is Lead Time?

**Lead Time** refers to the total time it takes from the moment a task is **requested or added to the backlog** to the moment it is **completed and delivered**. It measures the **end-to-end process** and gives insight into how efficiently a team delivers work.

---

## 2. What is Cycle Time?

**Cycle Time** refers to the time it takes from the moment a task **enters the “In Progress” state** to the moment it is **completed**. It focuses specifically on **active work time** and helps measure the team’s **efficiency during execution**.

## 3. Difference Between Lead Time and Cycle Time

| **Aspect**      | **Lead Time**                           | **Cycle Time**                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**  | Time from task creation to completion    | Time from starting work to completion  |
| **Scope**       | Includes waiting time and active work    | Only includes active work time         |
| **Insight**     | Measures responsiveness and delivery speed | Measures team efficiency during work |
| **Focus**       | Customer/Business perspective            | Team/Execution perspective             |

## 4. Formula for Lead Time and Cycle Time

### **Lead Time**:
\[
\text{Lead Time} = \text{Completion Date} - \text{Request Date}
\]

### **Cycle Time**:
\[
\text{Cycle Time} = \text{Completion Date} - \text{Start Date (In Progress)}
\]

## 5. Example of Lead Time and Cycle Time Calculation

### Scenario:
- **Task**: Implement a new login feature for the web app  
- **Request Date (Added to Backlog)**: October 1, 2024  
- **Start Date (In Progress)**: October 5, 2024  
- **Completion Date**: October 10, 2024  

### **Calculating Lead Time**:
\[
\text{Lead Time} = \text{October 10, 2024} - \text{October 1, 2024} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

- **Explanation**: It took **9 days** from the moment the feature was requested to the moment it was completed and delivered.

### **Calculating Cycle Time**:
\[
\text{Cycle Time} = \text{October 10, 2024} - \text{October 5, 2024} = 5 \text{ days}
\]

- **Explanation**: It took **5 days** of active work to complete the login feature, starting from the moment the team began working on it.

## 6. How Lead Time and Cycle Time Help Teams

1. **Lead Time Insights**:
   - Helps identify how **responsive** the team is to business needs.
   - Useful for **customer satisfaction** as it tracks how fast requests are completed.

2. **Cycle Time Insights**:
   - Helps measure **team efficiency** during execution.
   - Useful for **sprint planning** and predicting future delivery timelines.

## 7. How to Use Lead and Cycle Times for Improvement

1. **Identify Bottlenecks**:
   - If the lead time is much longer than the cycle time, it may indicate **waiting time in the backlog** or process delays.

2. **Optimize Work in Progress (WIP)**:
   - Monitoring cycle time helps identify **inefficiencies** and optimize WIP limits.

3. **Improve Customer Responsiveness**:
   - Reducing lead time ensures **faster delivery** and improves customer satisfaction.

4. **Forecast Future Work**:
   - Using historical lead and cycle time data, teams can **predict delivery timelines** more accurately.

## 8. Tools to Track Lead and Cycle Time

1. **JIRA** – Tracks issue life cycles, including lead and cycle times.  
2. **Azure DevOps** – Provides insights into work item duration and progress.  
3. **Trello** – With plugins, it tracks task durations.  
4. **Asana** – Monitors task creation and completion dates.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Both **Lead Time and Cycle Time** are essential metrics in Agile to understand how efficiently teams handle tasks. Lead time reflects the total duration from request to delivery, while cycle time focuses on the **active time spent on work**. By monitoring these metrics, teams can identify **bottlenecks, improve processes**, and deliver value faster.
