# Why Story Points are Assigned Using the Fibonacci Sequence

---

## 1. Introduction

In Agile, story points are often assigned using the **Fibonacci sequence** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...). This sequence reflects the **increasing uncertainty** and effort involved as tasks grow more complex. Since each number in the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers, it helps teams estimate in **relative terms**, emphasizing that as the complexity increases, the accuracy of estimates becomes less certain.

## 2. The Fibonacci Sequence in Story Point Estimation

The Fibonacci sequence provides a **natural, non-linear scale** that aligns with the way humans perceive effort and complexity. When assigning story points, larger tasks tend to have more uncertainty, and **the Fibonacci sequence helps reflect that**.

### Fibonacci Sequence:  
**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...**

## 3. Why Fibonacci Sequence Works for Story Points

### 1. **Handling Uncertainty as Complexity Increases**  
- The gap between consecutive Fibonacci numbers **widens as the sequence progresses**, mirroring the increasing **uncertainty** when estimating larger tasks.
- For example:
  - A task with **2 points** has a more predictable outcome than a **13-point task**.
  - This ensures that **larger estimates reflect higher uncertainty**.

### 2. **Encourages Quick Decision-Making**  
- Using a sequence like **Fibonacci limits the available options**, making it easier for teams to **converge on a consensus** during estimation sessions.
- Teams don't need to argue over small differences (e.g., whether a task is 4 or 5 points); they select the closest Fibonacci number instead.

### 3. **Captures the Non-Linearity of Effort**  
- As tasks grow more complex, the effort required increases **non-linearly**, not linearly. The Fibonacci sequence reflects this increase naturally:
  - A 5-point task is more than **twice as complex** as a 2-point task.
  - This ensures that the estimation process reflects **real-world complexities**.

### 4. **Promotes Relative Estimation**  
- The Fibonacci sequence helps teams compare tasks **relative to one another**.
  - If one task is 3 points and another is 8 points, the team can easily understand that the second task is **much more complex**.
- Relative estimation avoids the trap of exact time predictions.

### 5. **Avoids False Precision**  
- Using Fibonacci numbers prevents **overly precise estimates** (e.g., assigning 4.5 points). This encourages teams to focus on the **effort range** rather than exact values.
- This avoids a situation where minor changes in estimates consume unnecessary time.

## 4. Example of Using Fibonacci Sequence for Estimation

### Scenario:
1. **Story A**: Add a search bar to the website (Low complexity)  
   - **Assigned Points**: 2  

2. **Story B**: Implement payment gateway integration (High complexity, multiple dependencies)  
   - **Assigned Points**: 13  

3. **Story C**: Redesign the entire user interface (Very high complexity)  
   - **Assigned Points**: 21  

This example shows how larger stories receive higher Fibonacci numbers, reflecting both **increased effort and uncertainty**.

## 5. Challenges of Using Fibonacci Sequence

1. **Learning Curve**:
   - New teams may initially struggle with the **concept of relative estimation**.

2. **Gap Between Values**:
   - The gap between higher Fibonacci numbers can make it **difficult to decide between two options** (e.g., whether a task is 8 or 13 points).

3. **Risk of Overestimation**:
   - Teams might overestimate complex tasks, assigning unnecessarily high values without fully breaking down the tasks.

## 6. Conclusion

The **Fibonacci sequence** is widely used in Agile for story point estimation because it **reflects the non-linear nature of effort and uncertainty** involved in software development. By promoting **relative estimation** and limiting the number of options, it ensures quick decision-making and encourages teams to **focus on effort ranges** rather than precise time predictions. Over time, using Fibonacci-based story points helps teams improve their **estimation accuracy** and manage **complexity effectively**.
