# Document Review Responsibilities in Outsourced Software Development

### Overview

In an **outsourced software development project**, both the **client** and the **outsourcing company** play important roles in reviewing the various documents generated throughout the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. The extent of the client's involvement in the review process typically depends on the **contractual agreement**, **project management approach**, and the **communication model** between the two parties. However, in most cases, the client is actively involved in reviewing critical documents to ensure that the software being developed aligns with their business needs and expectations.

### Key Documents in the SDLC for Review

1. **Requirements Documents**
   - **Responsibility**: Typically, the client is highly involved in reviewing and approving these documents.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**
     - **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
   - **Why the client reviews it**: The requirements documents outline the project’s scope, business needs, and functional specifications. The client needs to verify that these documents accurately capture their expectations, as they serve as the foundation for the rest of the project.

2. **Project Plan and Timeline**
   - **Responsibility**: The client often reviews and approves the project plan and timeline, which are typically prepared by the outsourcing company.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Project Schedule**
     - **Milestones and Deliverables**
   - **Why the client reviews it**: The project plan defines timelines, deliverables, and resource allocation. The client needs to ensure that the schedule aligns with their goals and deadlines.

3. **Design Documents**
   - **Responsibility**: The outsourcing company usually prepares the design documents, but the client often reviews key deliverables.
   - **Examples**:
     - **High-Level Design (HLD)**
     - **Low-Level Design (LLD)**
   - **Why the client reviews it**: Design documents help ensure that the technical implementation matches the client’s vision for the product. The client may review aspects like UI/UX design, system architecture, and key feature design to ensure alignment with their needs.

4. **Testing Plans**
   - **Responsibility**: The outsourcing company typically prepares test plans and cases, but the client may review and provide input.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Test Strategy**
     - **Test Cases and Scenarios**
   - **Why the client reviews it**: Clients may review test plans to ensure that all critical functionality is being tested and that the software meets the quality standards required for release. Clients may also be involved in User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

5. **Prototypes and Demos**
   - **Responsibility**: Prototypes or demos are often shared with the client for review, particularly in Agile or RAD development.
   - **Why the client reviews it**: Reviewing prototypes helps the client verify that the product is progressing as expected and that key features are being implemented according to requirements.

6. **Progress Reports**
   - **Responsibility**: The outsourcing company provides regular progress reports, which the client reviews.
   - **Why the client reviews it**: Progress reports allow the client to track the project’s development and ensure it is on schedule and within budget.

7. **Final Documentation (User Manuals, Deployment Plans, etc.)**
   - **Responsibility**: Final project deliverables like user manuals and deployment plans are often reviewed and approved by the client before the final software handoff.
   - **Why the client reviews it**: The client must ensure that they have the necessary documentation for training, maintenance, and system support.

### Client’s Role in Document Review

1. **Validation and Approval**: The client reviews critical documents to ensure that the software being developed aligns with their **business requirements** and **expectations**. Approval from the client is often required before proceeding to the next phase of the SDLC.
   
2. **Ongoing Communication**: In **Agile** or **iterative development** models, there is continuous client involvement. Clients are expected to review **iterations**, **sprints**, or **prototypes**, providing feedback on a regular basis.

3. **Sign-Off at Key Milestones**: In traditional models like **Waterfall**, the client typically reviews and approves documents at key milestones before moving on to the next phase (e.g., after the requirements gathering phase, after design, etc.).

### Outsourcing Company’s Role in Document Review

1. **Document Preparation**: The outsourcing company is responsible for preparing all the necessary documents, including technical specifications, project plans, design documents, and test cases. They ensure the technical feasibility and implementation of the project.
   
2. **Internal Review**: The outsourcing company conducts its own internal reviews before submitting documents to the client. This helps ensure the quality and accuracy of the deliverables.

3. **Compliance with Contractual Requirements**: The outsourcing company ensures that all deliverables, including documentation, adhere to the agreed-upon **contractual requirements**, **timelines**, and **quality standards**.

### Final Decision on Document Review

In outsourced projects, it’s generally a **collaborative effort** between the client and the outsourcing company:

- **The client reviews**: Critical documents such as requirements, design, prototypes, and final deliverables to ensure they align with their business goals.
- **The outsourcing company reviews**: The technical aspects, manages documentation preparation, and ensures the project meets the technical and functional specifications.

### Conclusion

In an outsourced software development project, **both the client and the outsourcing company** are involved in the review of SDLC documents. The client’s role is to review and approve key documents to ensure that the project aligns with their needs, while the outsourcing company is responsible for preparing the documents and performing internal reviews to ensure technical accuracy and quality.
