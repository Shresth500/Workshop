# How to Estimate Projects in Scrum

In Scrum, if the estimates for tasks are made by developers only when they enter the Sprint backlog, it can be challenging to provide an accurate time estimate for the project before it starts. However, there are several techniques used to give stakeholders an early time estimate while embracing Agile principles.

## 1. High-Level Estimation During Product Backlog Grooming
- **When:** Before the sprint starts, during backlog refinement sessions.
- **Who:** Developers or Scrum team members.
- **How:** 
  - Use **story points** or **t-shirt sizing** (small, medium, large).
  - Developers estimate effort for each user story at a high level, even if not all details are available yet.
  - These rough estimates give a sense of the project scope early on.

**Why It Works:**
- Story points abstract complexity and avoid tying estimates to hours too early.
- The sum of story points for all backlog items provides a rough project size.

## 2. Velocity-Based Forecasting  
- **When:** After completing a few initial sprints.
- **How:**  
  - Calculate the team's **average velocity** (number of story points completed per sprint).
  - Divide the total estimated story points for the project by the team’s average velocity.

**Example:**
- Project size: 100 story points  
- Team velocity: 20 points per sprint  
- Estimated time: 5 sprints (10 weeks if sprints are two weeks each).

**Why It Works:**
- Early sprints reveal the team’s actual delivery speed.
- The forecast gets refined as the project progresses and velocity stabilizes.

## 3. Epic-Level Estimation at Project Start
- **When:** Before starting development.
- **How:**  
  - Group related user stories into **epics** (large chunks of work).
  - Estimate these epics in **story points** or relative sizes (e.g., 8 story points for Epic A, 13 points for Epic B).
  - This gives a **high-level** picture of the effort required across multiple sprints.

**Why It Works:**
- Stakeholders can get a ballpark idea of the workload.
- Teams avoid over-planning and adapt as stories become clearer.

## 4. Use Buffers and Rolling-Wave Planning
- **When:** Ongoing throughout the project.
- **How:**  
  - Introduce **buffers** in your estimates to account for uncertainties.
  - Use **rolling-wave planning**—you plan the immediate sprints in detail while leaving room to adjust future sprints based on learnings.

**Why It Works:**
- Reduces the risk of over-committing to early estimates.
- Aligns with Agile’s principle of adapting to change.

---

## 5. Communicating with Stakeholders Using Range Estimates
- Instead of giving a **single fixed timeline**, provide **range estimates** (e.g., 12-16 weeks) and update regularly.

**Example:**
- "Based on early estimates, the project may take 10-12 sprints. This is subject to change as we gather more information."

## Summary Workflow for Estimation in Scrum
1. **Pre-Project:** Epics or high-level stories are estimated in story points.
2. **Backlog Refinement:** Rough estimates are added to individual stories before the sprint starts.
3. **Sprint Planning:** Developers refine estimates for tasks that enter the sprint.
4. **During Project Execution:** Forecasting based on velocity improves estimates.
5. **Continuous Feedback:** Estimates are revised as the team learns more and progresses through sprints.

In Scrum, estimates evolve over time rather than being fixed at the beginning. The goal is to **balance flexibility with predictability**—early estimates give stakeholders a starting point, but velocity and sprint reviews provide continuous feedback to ensure the project stays on track.
