# How to Create a Burn-Up Chart in Agile

---

## 1. What is a Burn-Up Chart?

A **Burn-Up Chart** is a visual tool used in Agile to **track progress toward a project or sprint goal**. It shows how much **work has been completed** and how much **total work** remains, giving teams and stakeholders a clear view of progress toward the target. Burn-up charts are particularly useful because they **account for scope changes**, unlike burn-down charts.

## 2. Purpose of a Burn-Up Chart

1. **Track Completed Work vs. Total Work**:
   - Displays both **work completed** and the **total scope**, helping teams visualize progress clearly.

2. **Highlight Scope Changes**:
   - Any increase or decrease in the total work is visible, making the chart ideal for **dynamic environments** where scope may change.

3. **Predict Project Completion**:
   - Teams can use the chart to **forecast when all work will be completed** based on the progress trend.

## 3. Components of a Burn-Up Chart

1. **X-Axis (Horizontal)**:
   - Represents **time** (e.g., days or sprints).

2. **Y-Axis (Vertical)**:
   - Represents the **amount of work** (in story points, tasks, or hours).

3. **Total Scope Line**:
   - A horizontal line that shows the **total amount of work** planned (can change if the scope changes).

4. **Completed Work Line**:
   - A line that **increases over time** as the team completes work.

## 4. Steps to Create a Burn-Up Chart

### **Step 1: Collect Data**
- Determine the **total scope** (e.g., story points or tasks planned for the sprint or project).
- Example: The sprint scope contains **50 story points**.

### **Step 2: Define the Time Period**
- Decide the **time intervals** (e.g., daily updates during a sprint or per sprint in a project).

### **Step 3: Plot the X-Axis and Y-Axis**
- **X-Axis**: Days or sprints.
- **Y-Axis**: Total number of story points or tasks.

### **Step 4: Add the Total Scope Line**
- Draw a horizontal line representing the **initial scope** (e.g., 50 story points). If the scope changes, adjust this line accordingly.

### **Step 5: Track Completed Work**
- Each day or sprint, **add the completed story points** and plot the total progress so far.

### **Step 6: Connect the Data Points**
- Connect the daily or sprint-based data points to create the **completed work line**.

## 5. Example of Burn-Up Chart Data

| **Day** | **Story Points Completed** | **Total Scope** |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Day 1   | 5                           | 50              |
| Day 2   | 10                          | 50              |
| Day 3   | 15                          | 50              |
| Day 4   | 20                          | 55 (scope increased) |
| Day 5   | 30                          | 55              |
| Day 6   | 40                          | 55              |
| Day 7   | 50                          | 55              |

## 6. Interpretation of the Burn-Up Chart

1. **On Track to Complete**:
   - If the completed work line is moving steadily toward the total scope line, the team is **on track**.

2. **Scope Creep**:
   - If the total scope line increases (e.g., from 50 to 55), it indicates **scope creep**, meaning more tasks have been added to the backlog.

3. **Ahead or Behind Schedule**:
   - Teams can **compare progress trends** with their expected rate to see if they are ahead or falling behind.

## 7. Tools for Creating a Burn-Up Chart

1. **JIRA** – Automatically generates burn-up charts for sprints or projects.  
2. **Excel/Google Sheets** – Manually create charts using collected data.  
3. **Azure DevOps** – Provides built-in burn-up reports for teams.  
4. **Trello (via plugins)** – Supports visual tracking with charts.

## 8. Benefits of a Burn-Up Chart

1. **Visualizes Progress and Scope Changes**:
   - Clearly shows both **completed work and total scope**, helping teams monitor progress effectively.

2. **Manages Scope Creep**:
   - Changes in scope are easy to identify as the **total scope line shifts**.

3. **Encourages Transparency**:
   - Stakeholders can easily **track project progress** and understand the impact of any changes.

4. **Predicts Completion**:
   - Teams can use trends to **forecast the likely completion date**.

---

## 9. Challenges of Using a Burn-Up Chart

1. **Requires Regular Updates**:
   - Teams need to **update the chart frequently** to maintain accuracy.

2. **Scope Changes Impact Predictions**:
   - Frequent changes to the total scope can **affect forecast accuracy**.

3. **Overemphasis on Quantity**:
   - The chart focuses on the amount of work completed, which might lead to **overlooking quality**.

## 10. Conclusion

A **Burn-Up Chart** is a powerful tool in Agile to **visualize both completed work and scope changes** over time. It helps teams and stakeholders understand the progress toward the sprint or project goal while also accounting for any changes in the total scope. When used effectively, burn-up charts enhance **transparency, predictability, and planning**, ensuring teams stay aligned with their objectives.
