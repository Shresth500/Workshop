# Overview of Agile

---

## 1. Introduction to Agile

**Agile** is a **software development methodology** based on an **iterative** and **incremental approach**. Agile promotes **flexibility, adaptability, and collaboration** by delivering smaller, working software increments frequently rather than releasing a complete product at the end. It emphasizes **continuous feedback** from customers and stakeholders, ensuring the product evolves according to changing requirements.

Agile contrasts with traditional **waterfall methodologies**, where each phase of development is completed before moving on to the next. In Agile, teams **continuously improve** the product through **short cycles**, known as **iterations** or **sprints**.

## 2. Agile Manifesto and Principles

### **Agile Manifesto (2001)**

The Agile Manifesto outlines **four core values**:

1. **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools.
2. **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotiation.
4. **Responding to Change** over following a plan.

### **12 Agile Principles**:
1. **Customer satisfaction** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in the project.
3. Deliver working software **frequently** (from a couple of weeks to a couple of months).
4. Close collaboration between **business stakeholders** and developers.
5. **Motivated individuals** drive development, and teams should be supported and trusted.
6. **Face-to-face communication** is the most effective way to convey information.
7. Working software is the **primary measure of progress**.
8. Agile processes promote **sustainable development** with a consistent pace.
9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence** and good design improves agility.
10. **Simplicity**—maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. The best results emerge from [**self-organizing teams**](./miscellaneous/21-self-organizing-teams.md).
12. Regularly reflect on how to **become more effective**, adjusting processes accordingly.

## 3. Key Characteristics of Agile

1. **Iterative Development**:
   - Agile divides the project into small **iterations or sprints** (typically 1-4 weeks).

2. **Incremental Delivery**:
   - Delivering **small, usable features** incrementally ensures the product grows with continuous improvements.

3. **Customer Collaboration**:
   - Continuous involvement of **customers and stakeholders** provides feedback throughout the development cycle.

4. **Adaptability to Change**:
   - Agile welcomes changing requirements, even late in development.

5. **Cross-Functional Teams**:
   - Teams consist of **developers, testers, designers, and business analysts** working collaboratively.

6. **Self-Organizing Teams**:
   - Teams manage their own tasks and workflows, encouraging autonomy and ownership.

## 4. Agile Methodologies

Several frameworks implement Agile principles, including:

### 1. **Scrum**
- **Focus**: Iterative development with time-boxed **sprints** (1-4 weeks).
- **Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.
- **Meetings**: Daily Stand-up, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.

### 2. **Kanban**
- **Focus**: Visualizing workflow and limiting work in progress (WIP).
- **Key Concepts**: Kanban board with tasks moving from **To-Do → In Progress → Done**.
- **Goal**: Continuous delivery without defined iterations.

### 3. **Extreme Programming (XP)**
- **Focus**: Technical excellence through **continuous feedback, pair programming, and TDD (Test-Driven Development)**.
- **Practices**: Small releases, collective code ownership, continuous integration.

### 4. **Lean Software Development**
- **Focus**: Minimizing waste and maximizing value by following lean manufacturing principles.
- **Principles**: Eliminate waste, build quality in, empower teams, deliver fast.

### 5. **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**
- **Focus**: Scaling Agile principles to large enterprises.
- **Components**: Teams, Programs, Portfolios.
- **Key Practices**: Program Increments (PI) and Agile Release Trains.

## 5. Agile Roles

1. **Product Owner (PO)**:
   - Represents the **customer’s voice** and manages the **product backlog**.
   - Prioritizes features based on **business value**.

2. **Scrum Master (or Agile Coach)**:
   - Facilitates the **Agile process**, removes impediments, and ensures the team follows best practices.
   - Acts as a **servant leader** for the team.

3. **Development Team**:
   - Cross-functional team responsible for **design, development, and testing** of features.

4. **Stakeholders**:
   - Customers or business representatives who **provide feedback** and ensure that the product meets expectations.

---

## 6. Agile Artifacts

1. **Product Backlog**:
   - A **prioritized list of features and requirements** maintained by the Product Owner.

2. **Sprint Backlog**:
   - A subset of the product backlog selected for the current sprint.

3. **Increment**:
   - A working version of the product containing all completed features at the end of a sprint.

---

## 7. Agile Ceremonies and Meetings

1. **Sprint Planning**:
   - The team selects and plans work for the upcoming sprint from the product backlog.

2. **Daily Stand-up (Daily Scrum)**:
   - A short, time-boxed meeting (usually 15 minutes) where team members share:
     - What they did yesterday.
     - What they plan to do today.
     - Any blockers or challenges.

3. **Sprint Review**:
   - Demonstration of the **completed work** to stakeholders for feedback.

4. **Sprint Retrospective**:
   - A meeting to **reflect** on the sprint and identify areas for improvement.

---

## 8. Agile Metrics

1. [**Velocity**](./miscellaneous/26-velocity.md):
   - Measures how much work a team completes in a sprint (in terms of [story points](./miscellaneous/24-story-points.md) or hours).

2. [**Burn-Down Chart**](./miscellaneous/27-burndown-chart.md):
   - Tracks the amount of remaining work over time in a sprint.

3. [**Burn-Up Chart**](./miscellaneous/28-burnup-chart.md):
   - Shows progress towards completing the total scope of a release or project.

4. [**Lead Time and Cycle Time**](./miscellaneous/29-lead-and-cycle-time.md):
   - **Lead Time**: Time from task creation to completion.
   - **Cycle Time**: Time taken from starting the task to completing it.

5. **Cumulative Flow Diagram**:
   - Visualizes work in progress and identifies bottlenecks.

## 13. Conclusion

**Agile** is a flexible and adaptive methodology that enables teams to **deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently**. With its focus on **collaboration, continuous feedback, and incremental delivery**, Agile ensures that software evolves to meet customer needs. Despite challenges in scaling and managing frequent changes, Agile remains one of the most **widely used methodologies** due to its ability to **respond to change** and **deliver value early**.
