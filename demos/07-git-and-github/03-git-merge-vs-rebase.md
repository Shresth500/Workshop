# `git merge` vs `git rebase`: What’s the Difference?

Both `git merge` and `git rebase` are used to **integrate changes from one branch into another**, but they do it in different ways. Here's a detailed comparison to help you understand when to use each.

---

## **1. What is `git merge`?

`git merge` takes the **changes from one branch** (say `feature`) and **integrates them into another branch** (e.g., `main`) by creating a **merge commit**. It preserves the history of both branches.

### **How it Works:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature
```

- Git will create a **new merge commit** that combines the histories of both branches.

#### **Example:**
```
main:   A --- B ----------- E  (merge commit)
         \                  /
feature:  C --- D ----------
```

Here, `E` is the **merge commit** combining the changes from `main` and `feature`.

### **When to Use `git merge`?**
- **Preserving history** is important (you want to see when branches were merged).
- **For larger teams**: It makes the history easier to trace, as all branch merges are visible.
- If you want to **retain all individual commits** from both branches (without rewriting history).
- When **working in a shared repository** to avoid potential issues with rebasing.

---

## **2. What is `git rebase`?**

`git rebase` **moves or replays your local commits** on top of another branch. This creates a **linear history** by rewriting the commit history to appear as if everything happened in sequence.

### **How it Works:**
```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

- Git will **move all commits** from `feature` to be on top of `main`.

#### **Example:**
```
Before Rebase:
main:    A --- B
feature:       C --- D

After Rebase:
main:    A --- B --- C' --- D'
```

- `C'` and `D'` are **rebased versions** of `C` and `D`, with new commit hashes.

### **When to Use `git rebase`?**
- **For cleaner, linear history**, especially in **private branches**.
- When you don’t care about seeing when the branch was merged, just the final result.
- **For local work** or small teams, where rewriting history is manageable.
- When your branch hasn’t yet been pushed or shared with others (to avoid conflicts caused by rewriting history).

## **3. Key Differences Between `git merge` and `git rebase`**

| **Feature**                | **`git merge`**                                  | **`git rebase`**                                |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| History                    | Creates a **merge commit**.                      | Creates a **linear history** (rewrites commits).|
| Visibility                 | Shows **branch merge points** in history.        | History appears as if everything happened sequentially. |
| Commit Hashes              | Commits remain **unchanged**.                    | Commits get **new hashes** (rebased versions).  |
| Use Case                   | Useful in **collaborative repositories**.        | Useful for **clean local history** before sharing. |
| Risk                       | Safer, no rewriting of history.                  | Risky if shared branches are rebased (can cause conflicts). |

## **4. When to Use `git merge` vs. `git rebase`

- **Use `git merge`**:
  - When working on **shared branches** (like `main` or `develop`).
  - When you want to **preserve the history** and see the context of merges.
  - If you prefer **traceable branch integration** with visible merge commits.

- **Use `git rebase`**:
  - When working on **feature branches** or **personal branches**.
  - If you want a **clean and linear history** without merge commits.
  - When you haven’t shared your branch yet and can safely rewrite history.

---

## **5. Combining Both Approaches:**

A common workflow is to:
1. **Rebase locally** to clean up history.
   ```bash
   git checkout feature
   git rebase main
   ```
2. **Merge into the main branch** with a fast-forward merge (if there are no diverging commits).
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature --ff-only
   ```

This approach gives you both:
- **Clean feature branch history** using `rebase`.
- **Traceable integration** using `merge` when it matters.

---

## **Conclusion:**

- **Use `merge`** when working with shared branches or large teams to avoid the risks of rewriting history.
- **Use `rebase`** when you want a **clean history** and you are working locally or in a controlled environment.

Each strategy has its place, and it’s common to **combine both** in practice—using `rebase` for local cleanup and `merge` for branch integration.
