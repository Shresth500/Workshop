# What is NoSQL DB
- A NoSQL DB is one that stores information in a non-relational way, i.e. not in the form of tables and relationships between tables
- They usually do not use SQL for querying, hence the name
- More appropriately defined as "non-relational"
- They became popular due to needs of modern applications
    - Scalability
    - High Durability
    - Availability
    - Low Latency
    - Agility/Speed of Development
- NoSQL DBs achieve these while sacrificing
    - Expressive query language
    - Secondary Indexes
    - Strong Consistency for "Eventual Consistency"
