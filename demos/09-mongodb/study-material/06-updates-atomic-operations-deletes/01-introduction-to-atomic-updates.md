# Introduction to Atomic Updates
Atomicity refers to the feature where a DB query executes without interference from other queries happening concurrently. Though Mongo DB schemas are denormalized, MongoDB's updates make that structure reasonable.

    - replace the document altogether
    - use update operators to modify specific fields within the document.
